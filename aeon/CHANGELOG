This file is an experiment.  The idea is that if you add cool new features or
make changes to Mace, you should list them here so others have an easy way to
learn about them without reading your checkin log.  Please make an effort to
add things to it, so it stays up to date.

Thanks -

  Milestone: The 1000th changeset in mace-fullcontext branch is in the repository!

2011-06-29 (ckillian)
  Some recent change highlights include:

  1) Model checker and simulator code is both released to the public, and
    merged to a great extent.  Scripts no longer require a symlink of the
    modelchecker binary, they know how to search for the binary. (knagara)

  2) No files are created by the build system within the checked out
    directories.  This helps with multiple builds, etc.

  3) New local address handling enables model checking of services built
    on top of Chord/Pastry/etc.

  4) Support for "make test", which tests some basic functionalities to
    prevent or at least detect quickly broken commits.  I have a host which
    does a nightly update and build which includes running these tests.

  - The Mace Library has now been cleaned up a bit and documented in the source
    in a format automatically recognized by the doxygen tool.  You can now use
    doxygen to generate API documentation for the Mace Library.  See 
    mace/docs/doxygen/README for details.

2007-01-11
  - Mace serialization has been updated to be explicit about the size of types
    being serialized for portability.  Additionally, collections have been
    updated to support optional serialization, so you explicitly specify
    whether to serialize mace collections.

2007-12-12
  - Mace using CMake now supports building on Linux, MacOSX, and Win32 (using
    Cygwin or MinGW).  The old Makefiles may still work, but are no longer
    supported.  Note, MinGW build requires MinGW, Win32-PThreads, libregex,
    Boost, and OpenSSL to be install, in addition to Perl.  Appmacedon and
    filecopy have been tested to work across linux and win32 builds.  CGI does
    not work on windows, and HTTP has not been tested.  It may still use some
    file I/O calls on sockets, which doesn't work on Windows.

2007-12-04
  - Make Log::autoAdd take a regular expression rather than a fnmatch
    expression (or a substring from before).

2007-12-03
  - Add 1st-cut support for binary logging and binary state dumps.  Makes logs
    more efficient, but must use logreader to read the logs out.  Only takes
    effect if you select logs using LOG_BINARY (instead of LOG_FPRINTF).

2007-11-20
  - Add EXPERIMENTAL support for cmake.  Don't use unless you're willing to
    help fix bugs.  May not support building services outside of Mace yet.  
    Not documented yet.

2007-10-31
  - Split time functions into TimeUtil.  Remove random stubs from util.  Now
    random calls go to RandomUtil and time calls to TimeUtil.
  - Fix XMLRPC-related bug in auto types.

2007-10-12
  - Add support for trace=high.  Prints service state after *outermost*
    transition completes
  - Remove more of MACEDON code from BaseMaceService

2007-10-06 
  - Auto types in mh files now support methods and constructors as their
    service counterparts do.

2007-10-05 
  - Added generic support for C++ tests for model checking.  Create a
    "TestProperties" class of the name ServiceTester in the namespace of the
    service, and it will be a friend of the service.  Construct it in your
    MCTest.
  - Added Enum template class which provides printable and serializable
    wrappers for enums.  Serializability across compilers suspect.
