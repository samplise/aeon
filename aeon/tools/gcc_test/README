buildgcc.sh:
  It's a shell script that helps building different versions of gcc and have them installed in separate directory (not system-wide).
  It helps test ContextLattice code against different versions of gcc semi-automatically.
  usage:
  $ ./buildgcc.sh 4.7.2

compilemace.sh:
  After executing buildgcc.sh, this script helps iterate through all gcc versions that you have built, compile Mace against them, and then test them all.

  usage: (go to the mace build library)
  $ ../tools/gcc_test/compilemace.sh
